Ireland (and the whole world really) is in the midst of a economic crisis, with prices going through the roof! 

Added to this, there is a huge shortage of houses, which is driving the market all the way to the stars.

These clever guys built [this](https://simondarcyonline.com/daft/guess-the-house-price/): A quiz created using the Daft.ie API where users need to guess the house price or the monthly rent of real properties on Daft.ie

> **Note**: Daft.ie is the main website where Ireland advertises their properties for sale or rent.
