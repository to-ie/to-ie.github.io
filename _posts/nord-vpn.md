Okay, this can definitely be categorised as a rant. But it is worth sharing, as it just blows my mind.

The task at hand here is fairly simple: I am trying to change the email address associated to my NordVPN account. Should be fairly straightforward, right?

Wrong. Read on üëá

First, I had to fill in a form, providing all kind of info. Note here, that my latest transaction is two years old, and I have since, closed my bank account with the institution I did the transfer with. Not having the bank details required, I replaced them with '0'.

Hello, Theodre‚Äã,

Thank you for your letter.

Unfortunately, your provided payment information does not match records, therefore, we will not be able to proceed with the requested changes.

Could you please double-check your provided first 6 digits/expiry date once more and provide it to us?

Alternatively, please provide us a screenshot of the most recent charge to NordVPN from your bank statement.

Looking forward to your reply.

Hello Paulo,

Thanks for your email.
Please appreciate the last payment was done nearly 3 years ago and I do not have the payment details required at hand (they have expired).

Putting asside the fact that changing an email address should not be this difficult on any modern tech platform, please advise what other details you might require from me to change the email address.

The bank account used to purchase my subscription has been closed and I do not have access to hsitorical bank statements.

I attach the receipt to this email, in case this helps (downloaded from my account).

Kind regards,

Theo
```
NordVPN's reponse below. They explain to me their process and the reasoning behind it all. They even provide me with an alternative suggestion, which is appreciated of course. Only issue here is that both options available to me are hard to implement, as I am no longer a customer to the bank in question. **Email 3**:

Hello, Theo,

Thank you for your response.

As we are a security oriented company we do not take account change or deletion requests lightly, hence we request payment information to confirm ownership of the account, as we would not want anyone but the rightful owner making such changes.

Having said that, unfortunately, without the required card details or a screenshot of the charge from your bank statement, we will not be able to proceed with the email change for your account.

We would highly recommend contacting your previous bank in case they are able to provide further assistance in gathering the information.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

So I try to explain that the options available are not as straightforward. I try explore a different route; the migration of the subscritpion from one account to another (perhaps it is a different process? (**Email 4**)
```
Sep 9, 2021, 14:02 GMT+3

Thank you for your response.

I hope you can apreciate the complications of what your process requires, in this particular case.

Alternative to what we are discussing:

Can you please tell me what will be required to transfer one current license from one account to another?

All the best,

Theo
```

No luck! It's the same process! But I appreciate the empathy shown... **Email 5**:

Hello, Theo,

Thank you for your reply.

Let us apologize for the inconvenience this might cause you, unfortunately, we have to adhere to our regulations.

Having said that, to transfer active services from one account to another, the same payment details are required for confirmation as this is the only valid way for us to check account ownership.

Let us know if you have further questions.

At this stage, I realise that the thread is getting longer and, as I seem to be get a number of different customer service agents, a re-cap is probably useful. (From experience, when a thread becomes too long, the agents don't read the whole thread -- in the name of KPIs).
Seeing that I am starting to go in circles, I ask for my issue to be escalated. At this point, I am hoping that someone will be able to provide me with some sort of a solution. **Email 6**:
```
Sep 9, 2021, 14:50 GMT+3

Thanks Evita,

Just summarising, so I make sure I get this right.
In order to replace the email address or transfer the license from one account to another, we need either of the following:
- 6 digits/expiry date of card used to make payment.
OR
- a screenshot of the most recent charge to NordVPN from my bank statement.

In my case, I have closed the account used to purchase the subscription (subscription was purchased in Jul19) and disposed of the card (securely, of course).

Reaching out to my ex-bank, asking for records of a specific transaction that occured 2 years ago looks very unlikely, particularly as I am no longer a customer of this bank.
Even if they were able to do so, they would either (1) take a while till they can do that - banks don't move fast or (2) ask me for a payment for the service.
I doubt you are willing to cover any costs.

Could you please escalate this to a team who could find a solution to this very specific case?

I understand you take security seriously (and appreciate this hugely). I also get that you have internal processes you need to adhere to.
But all I am trying to do is change the email address on my account!

All the best,

Theo
```
This is where we get engulfed in a circular, non-ending loop. **Email 7**:

Sorry, computer says no! I have heard and understood that you need the bank details. I have also explained that I can't get you the required details. I also underline at this stage that I would really appreciate an escalation of the issue. **Number 8**:

Sep 9, 2021, 17:03 GMT+3

Hello Hipolito,

Indeed, you have mentioned that you are not able to proceed with ther request.
Hence my request for an escalation -- surely, changing an email address would not warrent such grief.

I understand your SLAs and targets to clear the queue as fast as possible, but on this particular case, I would ask for a closer look.

Happy to chat over the phone, if this helps bring the matter to a quicker resolution.

All the best,
```
No escalation offered, no phone support and no solution offered. Emails and chats are, apparently, the most effective way of solving this bottleneck. **Email 9**:

Hello, Theo,

We are sorry for any inconvenience you may have.

Sadly, we have no other way to verify your identity and we will not be able to proceed with the requested changes.

In addition, we do not offer phone support as we think that issues are fixed more effectively through emails and chats.

Let us know if there is anything else we can help you with.

Thank you Jacinda.

I have understood that, at a customer service rep level, you are unable to proceed.

What I don't seem to get accross is for some sort of management rep (or technical rep) to step in, understand the predicament and find a way to get past it.

I also understand that repeating what your colleagues have previously said is easy and convenient.
I am hoping the next answer will be something different.

This time, with more empathy, the same answer. Still no escalation or solution offered.Email **13**:

Ok, perhaps time for another recap. In case the agents have stopped reading the whole thread and are just responding on the back of the previosu response only. **Email 14**:
```
Sep 10, 2021, 10:29 GMT+3

Thank you for your reply Te√≥fila.

Unfortunately, it does not differ from what your colleagues have already provided me.

In order to save some time to the next agent who receives this request (and hopinfg that they will take that extra second to think outside the box on this one), I would like to re-summerise the issue:

Task at hand: I would like to change my email address on my account.

In order to replace the email address or transfer the license from one account to another, we need either of the following:
- 6 digits/expiry date of card used to make payment.
OR
- a screenshot of the most recent charge to NordVPN from my bank statement.

In this case, I have closed the account used to purchase the subscription (subscription was purchased in Jul19) and disposed of the card (securely, of course).

Reaching out to my ex-bank, asking for records of a specific transaction that occured 2 years ago looks very unlikely, particularly as I am no longer a customer of this bank.
Even if they were able to do so, they would either (1) take a while till they can do that - banks don't move fast or (2) ask me for a payment for the service.
I doubt you are willing to cover any costs.

What I am asking here, politely and patiently may I add, is for this query to be escalated. Be it Management or Technical Team (even security team would do!) to find a solution to this very specific case?

Please try avoiding replying the same thing as your 5 colleagues -- I get it, you can not proceed with these changes.
The question here is how are we going to achieve this change? (Surely, "I can't change your email on your account without you providing me the credit card number you used 2 years ago - the one you have informed us that you have closed the account and no longer hold the card" is not a valid answer?)

Please also take a second to appreciate how insane (for lack of a better word here) this situation is.
We live in 2021 and all I want to do is change the email address on my account -- you are asking me to contact my bank and retrieve 2-year old statements for a task that should be fairly straightforward!

Thank you so much for your (possible) help.
I really hope you will come up with an alternative response this time!

All the best,

Theo

Okay, we're getting somwhere! According to Adelina, the billing team has looked at my issue 'with great detail'! But no. **Email 15**:

Hello, Theodore,

Thank you for your response.

Our advanced billing team has looked into your issue with great detail and, unfortunately, a decision was made that no exception is possible in this case.

Please understand that as a security company we must verify account ownership before making any changes to a customer's account and since we do not collect any personal information except for payment details, this is the only way to complete the verification.

If we were to allow users to change their email addresses without confirmation, anyone with access to your account details would be able to make changes and abuse your account.

Having said that, in this case, we would highly recommend contacting your bank directly for further assistance, as the payment is only a couple years old and the bank should keep records of your transactions.

Lastly, we do understand your frustration and the inconvenience this might cause you, however, since customer security is our top priority, without proper verification, we will not be able to proceed further.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

What do you suggest I do now?

How did I not think about that! Here is a thought,out of the box thinking. **Email 18**:
```
Hello,

Thanks for getting back to me Hipolito.
At this stage, I feel like I have spoken to half of the customer care department. 

Asking the bank (where I am no longer a customer) to dig out a specific transaction from 2 years ago is bound to be delightful! (Imaging if you were asked to do so in order to change your email address on an online service! Realistically, I hope you can see how surreal this is!)

Anyhow, thinking outside the box here, and I was kind of half hoping one of you would come up with this suggestion, you require the bank details of the last transaction to do the change of email address, right?
If I was to use my current card to renew my current subscription, would I be able to give you these credentials to update my details?

If so, after all these interactions, how come nobody suggested this?
If not, jesus, you're making this really difficult.

Looking forward to hearing from you all.

All the best,

Theo

Sep 13, 2021, 16:58 GMT+3
