Here I was, thinking I was doing great, using Duck Duck go for my seaches until [this](https://techcrunch.com/2022/05/24/ddg-microsoft-tracking-blocking-limit/?guccounter=1) happened. Turns out they are sharing data with Microsoft's Bing search engine.

DAMN!

But look at what I stumbled upon: [Whoogle-Search](https://github.com/benbusby/whoogle-search)! 

As the git page puts it: 
> Get Google search results, but without any ads, javascript, AMP links, cookies, or IP address tracking. Easily deployable in one click as a Docker app, and customizable with a single config file. Quick and simple to implement as a primary search engine replacement on both desktop and mobile.

Runs on port 5000 (localhost:5000)
