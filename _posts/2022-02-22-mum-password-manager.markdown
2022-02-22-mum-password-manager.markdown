A few weeks back, my mother (70-odd years old) was victim of a phishing attack. Smishing to be exact. 

She got a text from what appeared to be the government, asking her to login to her account using her bank's card reader. For anyone not familiar with the Belgian government's authentication process, this is not uncommon. Turns out though that,on this occasion, this was somehow linked to a payment authorisation protocol and... well, she got scammed off a few thousand euros (!). 

Frightening, to say the least, for a person of that generation.

Being the good son I am (ahem) and edging on the border of paranoia when it comes to the online world, I took it upon me to give her a few pointers, for the next time. 

We covered the basics: 

## Don't blindly follow instructions
Just because an official-looking email tells you to do something, it does not mean you should do it! (Remember the good old "if he told you to jump from a window, would you?")

Take a second to think about why you are about to do what you are told to do. Does it make sense? If you're not sure, double check with the authority in question (or even do a quick ~~Google search~~ [DuckDuckGo](https://www.duckduckgo.com) search.)

***Note:**
Turns out she did do a quick online search, after the facts. Guess what? The web was full of mentions of that scam (word to word transcripts of the exact same text message!)*

## Stay away from the link

Here is a scenario. My bank sends me the message "To confirm your account, login through [www.bank.com/account](https://www.thisIsNotBank.com).

Now hover over the link `www.bank.com` and look at where it leads; `www.thisIsNotBank.com`. (Confused? Click on the link above and check the web address of the site you land on)

Just because the link appears to be pointing to a website you are used to, it does not mean it is the case! And, guess what? The bad bad people out there will make sure that the page you land on looks exaclty the same as the one you expect! (You won't even notice you're on the wrong site.)

So don't be fooled by links. If you are told to login to your account (and you have good reason to do so), open a new tab on your browser and go to the website directly.

## It is from a well known source, it must be safe

The common instinct is that, if the email comes from a brand I know (the bank, the government,...), it must be safe! **Wrong!** 

It is **because** the email appears to come from a reputable source that you need to double-down on vigilance! In the online world, trust no-one, verify everything.

&nbsp;


Okay okay, this is dandy, we've read/heard all this before. But, what took me by surprise is the fact that... she listened! And she appeared interested! So I took it upon me to introduce her to the concept of **not re-using passwords**.

&nbsp;

## The risk

*"This time, it was money. That's fine, the bank will probably (eventually) get it back to you. But what if it was your online account? Say someone stole your password through the same technique. Then what?"* (me to her)

The reality is that, if you are using the same password for all your accounts and you get phished (your password is compromised), then you are at the mercy of the bad bad guys out there. They get access to your insignificant account, then get into your inbox. From there, they can reset any account (Facebook, Instagram... your bank details, your official documents...)

## How easy is your password to guess?

Cracking a password (using software to try hundreds of possibilities at a time until the right password is found) is not rocket science. It does not take that long to do so either (depending on the complexity of your password).

***Note:** The password `Password1234` is much easier to crack than `NQ7y4!&$pGPLeoYFk?h3`.*

Take a look at the image below. How long would it take to find your password?

## How to check if my credentials are out there?

There is this cool website, [Have I Been Pwned](https://haveibeenpwned.com/), that collects all the data from known databreaches and lets you check if your email or password are in there. Check for yourself!

&nbsp;

Okay, back to my mother. 

&nbsp; 

I use [Dashlane](http://www.dashlane.com) as my password manager. One place where all my passwords are generated and stored. (They all look like this by the way: `NQ7y4!&$pGPLeoYFk?h3`). When I go to login to any online account, Dashlane pop ups and offers to fill in my password. Dandy!

So, I went ahead and registered to a family pack and gave access to my mother.

## A first step

Today, I spent an hour with her on a Zoom call (we live 934.69 km away from each other) and showed her how the password manager works (the browser plugin, the online portal, the app on the phone). We also installed the Chrome extension onto her laptop and added her first password ever. 

That is all we did, for now. But it is a first step! 

Now every time she logs in, Dashlane is going to ask her to save the password. 

## The next steps

After a while, she will have the majority of her passwords saved in the password manager and we will be able to see how many times she re-uses the same password, how many of them are weak, etc. We can then look at updating them with more robust, ugly-looking (but safe) ones. 

## Do you want to find out more? 

If you are interested in this and are not sure how to get started, I am happy to spend some time and run you through the basic workings of a password manager. It won't be long till you're up and running! Just email me at hello@wedesign.ie.
