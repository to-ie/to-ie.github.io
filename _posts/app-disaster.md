Where to begin… Let’s start with some context;

I am actively trying to use and purchase this guy’s product. It is available in an app format or paper format. Needless to say, the app version is much prefered.

Here is the catch though. It is only available on iOS (you need an iPhone).
At this stage, I am a bit taken aback. Surely there is an Andoid version available somewhere? The FAQs say they are working on it, ETA December 2021.

```
The app is currently available on iOS Apple devices only (iPhone or iPad). We’re working to bring The Body Coach app to everyone in the future, and hope it will be available on Android devices for Summer 2021. If you don’t have an iPhone or iPad, you can still complete our original 90 Day Plan.
```

Needless to say, I am not waiting till the end of the year for this. Few (good old fashioned) SMSs later, I manage to source (not one but) two iPhones to play with. Yes, they need a bit of TLC but nothing we can’t manage.

The first one, a wonderful iPhone 4, is locked. There is a pin and nobody can’t remember it. A few clicks later and fer password resets in, we’re in! Gosh, the screen size on these things is small! Or maybe my fingers have done fatter… Go figure.
Eventually, I reach the AppStore, download the app and…

```
This app is not compatible with this device.
```

Dangnam it! 🤨

No panic, we have another one. This one, a glorious iPhone 6, has a dead battery (and we have no cable available). I manage to source one from the neighbour (🙏), patientily wait for it to get some sort of battery charge (they don’t tend to charge faster if you stare at them) and off we go. We guess (!) the pin code on the device, format it and off we go again. Download the app and…

```
You need iOS 13.2 to use this app.
```

iOS 13.2? What on earth am I on? Iphone 6s are fairly recent right? (Then again, they did just announce the iPhone 13 so…). Anyhow, turns out I’m on iOs 12.5 or something, the highest this device goes to.

So now what?

I pinged an email to the customer care team of the website, maybe they have some historical versions of the app that might work with one of my devices. I also did some rummaging on the internet for solutions; The short amount of research indicates that I won’t be able to force iOS 13.2 on either of the devices. I am looking for an emulator for the laptops (Windows and Mac available) but can’t seem to find any particular software that allows access to the AppStore.

I am open to suggestions at this stage.

**Edit:** I eventually managed to find a device that would support iOS 13.2+. So all is dandy.
Did not manage to solve the problem technologically though, which is a bummer. 😣
