I just found this: [Cyberclopaedia](https://cr0mll.github.io/cyberclopaedia/index.html#the-cyberclopaedia).

**From the author:**
This is an aspiring project aimed at accumulating knowledge from the world of cybersecurity and presenting it in a coherent way, so it is accessible to as large and audience as possible and so that everyone has a good resource to learn hacking from.
