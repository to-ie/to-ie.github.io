Putting [this](https://mycroft-ai.gitbook.io/docs/using-mycroft-ai/get-mycroft) here, as a reminder to build it.

*Edit 24/9:* 

First build done. Itâ€™s actually usable! 
Granted, not as smooth and polished as the competition out there butâ€¦ open source! ðŸ’ª

Setting up the sound and spotify was a bit tricky.
A bit of tinkering with the output settings of the pi did the trick for the audio.
And for Spotify, once you follow [these instructions](https://github.com/forslund/spotify-skill#about) and make sure to get the beta version of the Mycroft skill, youâ€™re all set! 

Photos will follow, as soon as I make it stop looking like a pile of cables.

*Update (30/9):* 

Mounted the pi on a screen & speaker combo support. It loks much neater but the built-in fan is fairly loud. ðŸ™ƒ
