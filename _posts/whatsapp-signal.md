[This](https://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/121916/digital-id/protonmail-logged-ip-activist.html) happened this week and it has renewed the whole mobile messaging debate.

Signal came out with [this explanation](https://protonmail.com/blog/climate-activist-arrest/).

And then, a couple of data later, articles such as [these](https://arstechnica-com.cdn.ampproject.org/c/s/arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/09/whatsapp-end-to-end-encrypted-messages-arent-that-private-after-all/?amp=1) are flooding the web.

So, now what?

[Matrix.org](https://matrix.org/) seems to be a good solution, but it has not reached the popularity levels required yet.
