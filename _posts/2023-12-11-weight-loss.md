Here is a weight loss plan that's been a game-changer for me in the past (lies, but it worked quite well). This gem was passed on to me by a swanky gym, and I thought it could be just what you need, especially with the holiday season ahead of us.

The gist of it? Dive into a protein-packed diet and throw in some fun physical activities. 

## Tips
- Use herbs, spices, garlic, lemon and seasoning to add some flavour to the food. 
- Don't use any ready-made meals, tinned, frozen producs. 
- Use skimmed or low fat milk. 
- Do not take any sugar or cream.

Ok, here is your food plan:

---

- Coffee (black), herbal tea or water
