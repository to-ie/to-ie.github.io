Oooooh yeah! I have been looking for a decent RSS feed that would not be cloud-based. (You know, the whole paranoia, keeping your data to yourself, etc...) Granted, this comes with the disadvantage of not having it synck'ed acorss devices, but I can live with that.

So, imagine how happy I was when I discovered [YARR](https://github.com/nkanaev/yarr). It does exactly what you'd expect the RSS reader to do, just locally hosted.

Special thanks to [Jeremy](https://noted.lol/3-of-my-favorite-foss-rss-readers-for-windows/) that lead me to the discovery of YARN.
