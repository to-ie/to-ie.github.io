I stumbled on this [Flask Mega-Tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world) on Reddit a few days ago and started following it. 

I am amazed at how simply Miguel describes the different sections, and how, 5 years after writing the tutorial, he is still active on the comments, helping people out! So much so, that I purchased [his book](https://smile.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B09YQ33QYT/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_asin_title_o00_s00?ie=UTF8&psc=1), to show some support.

Oh, and I just realised, whilst writing this post, that he lives in Drogheda (Ireland)!
