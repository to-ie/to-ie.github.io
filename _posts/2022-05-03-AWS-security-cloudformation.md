I have been battling hard to secure our AWS accounts at work, until I found this: [A Secure Cloud](https://asecure.cloud/l/s_vpc/).

**Configuration Library: 750+ Configuration Templates**: Deploy individual configurations for AWS resources from EC2 instances, RDS databases, Config Rules, Threat Detection and hundreds of more resources.

Needless to say, this saved me insane amount of time! ðŸ¥³
