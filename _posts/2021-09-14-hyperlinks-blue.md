**TLDR;** 

In January 1993, the company Mosaic did it first: 

The first beta version of Mosaic was created for the X Window System for the University of Illinois. The original interface was black and white and did not have blue hyperlinks, but had black hyperlinks with a bordered outline. According to the X System user guide, the hyperlinks were underlined or highlighted.
April 12, 1993 â€“ Mosaic Version 0.13

In the changelog for Mosaic for version 0.13, there is one bullet that is of great importance to us:

> Changed default anchor representations: blue and single solid underline for unvisited, dark purple and single dashed underline for visited.
