## Description

This is a project triggered from the completion of the Flask Mega Tutorial by Miguel Grinberg.

The project is simple: a web-app that users can use to get inspiration on what to do on a rainy day, in Dublin. Users can also suggest activities.

The aim of the project is for me to test my new-learnt Flask skills.
